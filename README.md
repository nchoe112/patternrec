I followed the 'Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition for Algorithmic Forex and Stock Trading' series by sentdex on YouTube, which explains how to implement pattern recognition for algorithmic trading. I made a few edits to the original code, including replacing repeated calls with iterations for recording patterns. Additionally, I updated the code to include a function for date parsing, reflecting the latest updates to the datetime package.
